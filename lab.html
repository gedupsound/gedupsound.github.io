		<h1> Minimal Virtual Lab Project </h1> <p>
		<p>
		This page is to track my recent project developing a virtual environmet to learn some new (to me) tools around container-based virtualization and configuration management.

		The diagram above outlines the solution I used for resolving a kubernetes-hosted service outside of the kunernetes cluster.
		I feel it meets the needs of a personal lab environment without the the overhead of configuring more complex solutions.
		Note that there are more appropriate solutions for solving this in a production environment (see: cloud provider load balancer or ingress controller)
		where scaling efforts and more complex requirements must be considered. I hope to outline the pros the cons of my implementation as it relates to a lab
		deployment for sake of learning. <p>
