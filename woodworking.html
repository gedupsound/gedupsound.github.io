		We've lived in our current home for a number years, and our "organization system" in our backyard has consisted of storing things in our shed,
		the side of the house where no one enters but us, and directly on the patio under the eave of the roof. The shed has long since been stuffed full,
		and the side yard a nice place to put large things we dont mind being left in the sun and rain. We needed storage that is protected from the weather
		and in a convenient location for many small outdoor things that wouldnt look a perpetual garage sale display on our patio. I built up the courage to 
		show family and friends that my building skills were actually useful. And so I built the patio cabinet.
