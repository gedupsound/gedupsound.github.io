		I have been taking on more projects that involve wood, which also usually involves some form of "finishing". I made the bartop arcade cabinets for myself and my co-workers, and they've been a bit hit. The "fight stick" consoles were made for a more compact joystick setup. I made the red one for myself, and the blue/black for a co-worker. <p>
