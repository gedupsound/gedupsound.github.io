		I always wanted to fly RC planes as a kid. At some point I remembered this notion and a friend recommendeded a transmitter and a beginner quad copter to learn the controls. Quadcopters led to learning and acquiring FPV (first person view) radio equipment, which afforded an incredible flight experience. And inevitably this lead to be building foam board airplanes. <p>
