		Gabe McGinnis - Zoom Licensing Reconciliation
	</title>

	<body>
		<h1>Zoom Licensing Reconciliation Utilizing Zoom's API (Powershell)</h1> <p>
    		<p>
		Our rapid deployment of Zoom for COVID-19 response compressed planning and configuration to a very small amount of time. One of the challenges
		we encountered involved ensuring and auditing that all users had appropriate licensing assigned. Shibboleth IDP/SSO is our primary means for
		authentication and assignment of licensing, based on affiliation to the organization. However, the rules/policies configured for SSO login and
		licensing assignment works ONLY if this is the first time a user has ever logged into a Zoom environment. If a user has an existing Zoom account
		associated to any other zoom "account", such as a personal account, this will (in short) cause the user to go through an alternate user creation
		process that does not allow Shibboleth to validate the user's affiliation, and thus, the user will be assigned the "default license", which our
		account/tenant is configured. 
		<p>
		While the majority of our user base was served perfectly by the Shibboleth SSO login process, a good number of thousands did not have the proper
		onboarding experience, and this created licensing mismatches that became a laborious daily task for us as hundreds of new users were ingressing daily.
		The challenge was ensuring that the right users have the right licenses, and the reason I developed this script.

#
# Purpose: Audit users in the Zoom tenant with no group membership, determine if they have the right user license, and assign them to Faculty or Students
#
# Requirements: PowerShell 5.1 (and likely anything newer), running on PowerShell older than 5.1 yielded hanging and eratic performance.
#               
# Logs: "C:\logs\zoom\" <---- Directory must exist for logging to work.
