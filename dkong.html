		<h1>Donkey Kong (1981)</h1> <p>
    		There's a quality to Donkey Kong that I just love, and it keeps me coming back. Known for its difficulty, Like most arcade titles, it takes some time and effort to gain
		appreciation for the game. I approached Donkey Kong not unlike a new hobby, or new skill: practice, practice, practice! Progress happens quickly, and its
		measurable, to a certain degree, in your scores. I was never one to care too much about a high score on a game just for the sake of a score, but with
		Donkey Kong it's a different story.
