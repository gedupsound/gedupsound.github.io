		<h1> Minimal Virtual Lab Project </h1> <p>
		<p>
		This page is to track my recent project developing a virtual environmet to learn some new (to me) tools around container-based virtualization and configuration management.

		Here is the solution I came up that I felt made the most sense, for the scope of my lab. Note that there are more appropriate solutions <br>
		for solving this in a production environment, where scaling efforts and more complex requirements must be considered. I hope to outline the <br>
		pros the cons of my implementation as it relates to a lab deployment for sake of learning. <p>
